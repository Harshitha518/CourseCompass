# Course Compass

Course Compass is an app that assists 9th-grade students who are entering high school, to create a tentative 4-year course plan, simplifying the traditional process of selecting classes to take throughout high school, ensuring they meet graduation requirements and can take desired courses in the future. Course Compass aims to provide students with a simple, quick, intuitive, and visually structured way to plan ahead for their high school journey. The goal is to ensure students feel confident and informed as they map out their 4-year plan.

To achieve this, Course Compass focuses on the simplicity and visual aspect. Users can select the courses they plan to take in 9th grade and will be given a visual table of pathways they can take, keeping in mind prerequisites, difficulty levels, and graduation requirements. They can select which pathways best work for them, and hand-select electives. They will be given a simple, visually clear, and appealing view of their plan.

Implementing simple frameworks that offer robust features for building interactive and responsive interfaces, like SwiftUI and PDFKit, Course Compass creates a seamless experience where students can easily input their preferences, explore different course options, and see the impact of their choices in real-time.

Overall, Course Compass offers a personalized approach that ensures that each student's plan is tailored to their unique needs, providing them with the best possible guidance. By keeping the app simple and user-friendly, this app will empower rising 9th graders, giving them the confidence to make informed decisions regarding the scheduling process.
